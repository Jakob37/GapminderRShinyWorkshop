What can R-Shiny do for you
========================================================

For more details on authoring R presentations please visit <https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468>.

- Easily allows interaction with data
- If you analyze data - can help you rapidly explore different views
- If you share data - Can allow the end-user to explore and find conclusions in the data
- Can be used to (relatively) easily build interactive software

How can it be deployed?
========================================================

- Can run it locally
- Can easily run on a custom server (amazing!)
- Can host on dedicated servers (free - to a certain point)

What is the structure of R-Shiny
========================================================

- UI and server (illustration)

What makes R-Shiny a bit different: Reactive programming
========================================================

- Basic illustration of reactive programming

The dataset: Gapminder
========================================================

- Thought it would be nice with a positive dataset!
- URL
- What is the data we show here?

What will we learn
========================================================

Introduction:

- Rapid recap of ggplot2 and dplyr
- The basic UI / server structure
- How to do UI input elements
- How to link these to interactive plots
- Showing the data simultaneously in multiple plots
- Buttons, and observeEvent

Some intermediate topics
========================================================

Intermediate

- Rendering data tables nicely using the DT library
- Using reactive values
- Using Plotly to increase the interactivity of the plots further
- Modules
- Using custom Javascript in the code

Structure of this workshop
========================================================

1. Brief introduction
    - What is R Shiny
    - What is the basics of UI / server
    - What is reactive programming
    - What is the table of content
    - Recap ggplot2 and dplyr
2. Loop the practical part
    1. Show a minimal proof-of-concept for each stage
    2. Send them off to implement it themselves, and encourage some exploration around the topic
    3. Gather for any questions, and continue to the next part
